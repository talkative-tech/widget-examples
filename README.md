# Talkative Chat Widget Code Examples

The Talkative Chat widget has been designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy. It can be included in your
website with a single line of script to import and load the widget. A GTM compatible script is also available for
users wishing to load the widget via GTM.

In some cases, some custom solutions might need to be implemented to add additional functionality, like custom
call-to-action buttons which allow users to trigger an interaction from another section of your website outside
the chat widget or by prefilling the data collection form by providing the interaction data via the API.

This repository contains heavily commented examples of some of these implementations which you can use as a basis to 
make these implementations within your own website.

Please note: these code examples should not be simply copied and pasted directly into your website. They are here to
demonstrate the lifecycle of events and to be a guide for you to implement the additional functionality.

For these examples, you will need a Talkative account. If you do not have one, you can visit our website to arrange
a demo and [sign up for a trial account](https://gettalkative.com/free-trial)
